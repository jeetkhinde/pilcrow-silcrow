## 2025-02-14 - [Silcrow JS Runtime Optimizations]
**Learning:** The silcrow headless store implementation (`silcrow/src/silcrow.js` in `mergePath`) was shallow copying previous state tree objects *before* actually detecting any differences in nested paths. When identical API payloads (very common in subscriptions/polling) are processed, this causes unnecessary allocations and GC overhead proportional to the tree size.

**Action:** When implementing structural sharing/immutable state updates in vanilla JS, always defer shallow object cloning until a mutation is definitively detected. If iterating properties finds no change, return the original reference (`prev`) directly without having allocated a throwaway clone.

## 2025-02-17 - [Silcrow JS DOM Sanitization Optimization]
**Learning:** The silcrow client-side runtime (`silcrow/src/silcrow.js` in `sanitizeTree`) was performing multiple DOM traversals using `querySelectorAll` for each forbidden tag and then again for all elements. This caused unnecessary DOM scanning overhead proportional to the tree size and the number of forbidden tags.
**Action:** When sanitizing DOM trees, consolidate traversals into a single pass over all elements (`querySelectorAll("*")`) and perform checks (forbidden tags, namespace validation) sequentially within that single loop to reduce performance cost.
